# ENHANCED PLANT DISEASE DETECTOR
#### A model to recognize and classify plant diseases from examining the leaves carrying the disease. In this project, two models are trained with two different kinds of data. In 'main.ipynb' the image data used is in RGB format, and HSV in 'HSV_main.ipynb.' The aim is to maximize the accuracy of the model using two different kinds of color format and find out which one gives better results, and also highlight the part of the leaf carrying the disease.

## Dataset: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/abdallahalidev/plantvillage-dataset

## To run the code:
#### 1. Install the latest versions of Numpy, Matplotlib, Lime, Tensorflow, OS, and OpenCV.
#### 2. Download and unzip the dataset file from the given link and replace the 'train_dir' with '{address of the data file in your PC}\color'
#### 3. Run all the cells one by one, pleasee keep your PC connected to a constant power supply.
