# ENHANCED PLANT DISEASE DETECTOR
#### This project aims to recognize and classify plant diseases by analyzing leaf images. Two distinct models are trained using image data in different color formats: 
- **RGB Format** in `main.ipynb`, and its demo in `demo,ipynb`
- **HSV Format** in `HSV_main.ipynb`, and its demo in `HSV_demo.ipynb`
#### The primary goal is to maximize the accuracy of the models while comparing the performance of these color formats to determine which is more effective. Additionally, the project includes a feature to visually highlight the diseased areas on the leaves.

## Dataset: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/abdallahalidev/plantvillage-dataset

## To run the code:
1. Install the latest versions of **Numpy, Matplotlib, Lime, Tensorflow, OS, and OpenCV.**
2. Download and unzip the dataset file from the given Kaggle link.
3. To run the main files, replace the `train_dir` with `{path of the data file in your PC}\color`, and run all the cells one by one. Please keep your PC connected to a constant power supply.
4. To run the demo files, please replace `dataset_path` with `train_dir` used in main files, and select any image from the dataset and replace `img_path` with its path.
