# ENHANCED PLANT DISEASE DETECTOR
#### This project aims to recognize and classify plant diseases by analyzing leaf images. Two distinct models are trained using image data in different color formats:  
#### **RGB Format** in `main.ipynb`  
#### **HSV Format** in `HSV_main.ipynb`  
#### The primary goal is to maximize the accuracy of the models while comparing the performance of these color formats to determine which is more effective. Additionally, the project includes a feature to visually highlight the diseased areas on the leaves for better interpretability.

## Dataset: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/abdallahalidev/plantvillage-dataset

## To run the code:
#### 1. Install the latest versions of Numpy, Matplotlib, Lime, Tensorflow, OS, and OpenCV.
#### 2. Download and unzip the dataset file from the given link and replace the 'train_dir' with '{address of the data file in your PC}\color'
#### 3. Run all the cells one by one, pleasee keep your PC connected to a constant power supply.
